        particular times of the year. Coming out from the province of Terengganu in Malaysia, this 
        griddle cookery is conventionally eaten in the morning but could be taken anytime of the day. 
        The major component of this dish is rice cooked in coconut milk and small seeds of this plant, 
        which provide it with creamy taste and memorable, pleasant scent.<br><br>The rice is usually 
        served with scores of accompaniments, the most famous of which is <strong>gulai ikan tongkol</strong>
         (Tuna curry). The fish is fried and simmered in coconut milk based gravy; blended with a 
        combination of spices that are common to the tropical region, such as turmeric, lemongrass, 
        and galangal to produce the spicy hot, and aromatic flavor. Additional dishes which may 
        complement the staple rice, may be served alongside include fried eggs or boiled eggs and 
        pickles or sambal which gives the meal a different and yummy option.<br><br>Nasi Dagang is 
        part of the Terengganu traditions especially since it special dishes served during sunrise 
        occasions such as festivals or large family gatherings. Their taste perfectly describes the 
        balance between Terengganu crops and conventional cooking procedures; that makes this meal 
        extremely attractive to all the guests willing to taste the wonders of Terengganu cuisine. 
        Despite the fact, Nasi Dagang is not simply a meal; it is a small culinary experience 
        pertaining to Terengganu’s heritage.`,

        description: `The authentic culinary product called <strong>Laksa Terengganu</strong> is still
        one of the most significant delights of Terengganu. It heavily differs from the rest of the 
        Malaysian laksas by their taste and the way they are prepared. Now it delights the gourmets
        with rice noodles in thick fish-based gravy made of fresh mackerel or other local fish, coconut 
        milk and spices – turmeric, lemongrass and shallots. The outcome is a barely hot and rather 
        tasty gravy which flavours are not overpowering but rather warm and soothing.<br><br>This is 
        because the Laksa Terengganu uses <strong>ulam-ulaman</strong> (portfolio of fresh herbs and 
        vegetables available locally) on the toppings. These may include thinly sliced cucumber, bean 
        sprouts, daun kesum or the Vietnamese coriander, and in some cases finely shredded bunga 
        kantan or the torch ginger flower. Such fresh ingredients are then added into the dish as a 
        way of creating a contrast against the creamy gravy that is usually made.<br><br>What sets 
        Laksa Terengganu apart is the use of <strong>budu</strong> – a fish-based sauce or sambal, 
        in case one wants a little extra kick. Famous as a meal shared by families, eaten during 
        festive occasion, or bought from the streets, Laksa terengganu is definitely a dish that 
        represents the Terengganu’s follicle food culture that food hunters should not miss.`,

        outer part.<br><br>Keropok Lekor has the best quality when it is still hot, in special 
        occasions it comes with a sauce, made from chili, vinegar and sugar which gives an extra
